Following Trump's election in 2016 you wrote a letter to yourself and asked us to send it to you two years later. That time has arrived, and the upcoming midterms are just a few days away. We hope your own words will compel you to vote, as well as donate or take action in different ways.

If you'd like more information on early voting in your area, volunteer opportunities, or good places to donate, reply to this email and a human being will reach out to you.
